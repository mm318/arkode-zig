ARKODE is a package for the solution of stiff, nonstiff, and multirate ordinary
differential equation (ODE) systems (initial value problems) given in linearly
implicit the form

  $$M(t) \\, y' = f_1(t,y) + f_2(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0$$

The integration methods implemented in ARKODE include explicit and implicit
Runge-Kutta methods, implicit-explicit (IMEX) additive Runge-Kutta methods, and
multirate infinitesimal (MRI) methods.

ARKODE is part of a the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKODE, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS, and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C and can be used in a variety of computing
environments including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and
accelerator-based (e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a
modular design that leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and
nonlinear solver APIs used across SUNDIALS packages.

## Installation ##

Add the dependency in your `build.zig.zon` by running the following command:

```
zig fetch --save=arkode_zig https://github.com/mm318/arkode-zig/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```

Then, in your `build.zig`:

```
const std = @import("std");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {
    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});
    const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{});

    const arkode_dep = b.dependency("arkode_zig", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    const arkode_artifact = arkode_dep.artifact("arkode");

    const your_exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
        // your other options...
    });
    your_exe.addIncludePath(arkode_artifact.getEmittedIncludeTree());
    your_exe.linkLibrary(arkode_artifact);
}
```
